## Explanation
A site to host, display and play local music.

## Problem
The intention was to learn, experiment with, test and implement various components of frontend web design and development.

## Solution
Before the project was begun the goals were enumerated. The components to be covered were:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- DOM Scripting,
- JavaScript,
- jQuery,
- AngularJS,

## Results
Once the desired components had been enumerated and researched a site structure was constructed. Three user interface pages were constructed: A home page, a page to display available albums and a page centered around a specific album. JavaScript animation was added to the home page. The display page was constructed to iteratively display a list of albums by looping through the album list stored in a specified asset directory. The last page accessed a specific album, listed it's individual tracks as well as other relevant information and used the Buzz JavaScript library to play the music.


## Conclusion
Once the site had been designed, implemented and tested using vanilla DOM scripting it was refactored using JavaScript, jQuery and finally AngularJS.
    By solving the same set of problems with several different sets of tools a greater understanding of the material was instilled upon the user, furthermore the relative benefits and limitations of each set of tools was established in a controlled environment independent of the relative complexity of differing projects.
