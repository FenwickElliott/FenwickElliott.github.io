title: Entropic Morality
---


While difficult to define and enforce, I will never be able subscribe to any code of morality not fundamental based on utilitarianism.

>“The right thing to do in any situation is that which causes the greatest good for the greatest number of people”

However I think there is a component not typically included, and that is the finite quantity of entropy left in this universe.

Entropy, the quantification of disorder, is the fundamental driving force of everything that has or will ever happen in the observed universe. It is the sole criteria for what is possible; man can fly; [we can transmit brain signals between mammals](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23221-first-mind-reading-implant-gives-rats-telepathic-power/); [we can exploit relativistic effects to skip forward in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) but we will never be able to travel back in time because it would violate the most fundamental law that exists: things must get more messy with everything that happens. Happening incurs entropy but entropy has an upper limit.

If the domain of our universe is a glass of water the big bang was an ounce of soluble dye being poured in. At first there is an explosion as the two meet, the clash and swirl celestially, there is beauty, variation and chaos but gradually the contrast becomes less stark, the system equilibrates. Eventually the glass is uniform. Entropy is maximized and nothing further will happen. Ever.

Surely the maxim of utilitarianism must become:



> “The right thing to do in any situation is that which causes the greatest good for the greatest number of people **per unit entropy**""
