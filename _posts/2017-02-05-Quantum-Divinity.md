title: Quantum Divinity
---

I happen to be an atheist but when I learnt about quantum mechanical effects like tunneling it struck me that it allowed for divine intervention within the bounds of science.

Just as Newtonian laws cease to apply when traveling at great speeds, they cease to apply at quantum levels. All sorts of phenomena prohibited by normal rules start occurring. Tunneling being a perfect example.

Tunneling is a process where a particle that exists in one place can migrate to another without any possible path between the two.

Imagine a jail with two adjacent cells and a prisoner in one. In our world it’s impossible for the prisoner to travel from one cell to the other without someone opening a door. It’s possible for him to be in cell A or in cell B but impossible for him to exist in the wall so he is trapped. Without an available path he is unable to move between the two but that is not the case on a quantum level. On a quantum level the barrier might prevent the particle from existing within it but that doesn’t prevent the particle from being able to skip back and forth from one side to the other. This effect is called tunneling and while it is only observed on a small scale under some very specific circumstances it is nonetheless a real and observable phenomena.

The reason it’s possible is that for quanta, existence is delocalized. That is to say they don’t exist in any exact location, there is a cloud of places where they might exist. Every time you measure it’s location you will find it to be somewhere in that cloud. The technical term for this cloud is 'wavefucntion' and the particle has varying probabilities of being found at any given location. If you repeatedly measure the cloud you can map it and it will match up to the theoretically predicted wavefunction but for any particular measurement there is no way to predict where in the cloud you will find the particle.

If the wavefucntion (cloud) were equally spread over the two jail cells and you measured it’s location you would find it in cell A half the time and cell B half the time. Just like flipping a coin there is no way to predict whether each iteration will be A or B, heads or tails but if you do it an infinite number of times the averages will map up exactly to what theory suggests.

In practice wavefunctions aren’t equally distributed over two jail cells. The simplest wavefunctions are spherical with probabilities decreasing exponentially with distance from the center of the sphere. This spherical cloud is very common, it maps things like an electron orbiting a proton in a hydrogen atom. Saying that the the electron and proton are together is an axiom that chemistry is founded on but it’s an assumption that isn’t entirely valid. The cloud is actually infinite albeit with the probability dropping to infinitesimal very quickly. Treating very unlikely things as impossible is entirely necessary for functioning in the real world but effects like tunneling testify to the invalidity of that assumption and while tunneling is only practically observed with very small very volatile particles across very small barriers it is possible under any circumstances. It is not impossible, just very unlikely that every particle in a human might spontaneously tunnel from one side of a wall to another. A miracle not allowed for in Newtonian mechanics.

So while a religious layman might define a miracle as God's intervention to make the impossible possible a religious quantum scientist would describe is as God making an absurdly unlikely event to transpire, within the rules of nature.
